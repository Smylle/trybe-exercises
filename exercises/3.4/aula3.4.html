         <h2> Fatos sobre o STOMATOPODA</h2>
         <p class="text-center">
          Eyes are testaments to evolution’s creativity. They all do the same basic things <br>
          detect light, and convert it into electrical signals—but in such a wondrous variety of <br>
          ways. There are single and compound eyes, bifocal lenses and rocky ones, mirrors and <br>
          optic fibres. And there are eyes that are so alien, so constantly surprising, that after <br>
          decades of research, scientists have only just about figured out how they work, let <br>
          alone why they evolved that way. To find them, you need to go for a swim. <br>
          This is the eye of a mantis shrimp—an marine animal that’s neither a mantis nor a <br> 
          shrimp, but a close relative of crabs and lobsters. It’s a compound eye, made of thousands <br> 
          of small units that each detects light independently. Those in the midband—the central stripe <br> 
          you can see in the photo—are special. They’re the ones that let the animal see colour. <br>
          Most people have three types of light-detecting cells, or photoreceptors, which are sensitive <br> 
          to red, green and blue light. But the mantis shrimp has anywhere from 12 to 16 different photoreceptors <br> 
          in its midband. Most people assume that they must therefore be really good at seeing a wide range of colours—a <br> 
          “thermonuclear bomb of light and beauty”, as the Oatmeal put it. But last year, Hanna Thoen from <br>
           the University of Queensland found that they’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re <br> 
           much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re <br> 
           much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between colours than <br> 
           most other animals! They seem to use their dozen-plus receptors to recognise colours in a unique <br> 
           way that’s very different to other animals but oddly similar to some satellites. <br> 
           Thoen focused on the receptors that detect colours from red to violet—the same rainbow <br> 
           we can see. But these ultra-violent animals can also see ultraviolet (UV). The rock mantis <br>
            shrimp, for example, has six photoreceptors dedicated to this part of the spectrum, each one <br>
             tuned to a different wavelength. That’s the most complex UV-detecting system found in nature. <br> 
             Michael Bok from the University of Maryland wanted to know how it works.

         <p class="text-center">Odontodactylus scyllarus is one of the larger, more colourful mantis shrimps commonly seen, <br> 
          ranging in size from 3 to 18 cm (1.2 to 7.1 in).[1] They are primarily green with orange legs and leopard-like <br> 
          spots on the anterior carapace.
          Their ability to see circularly polarised light has led to studies to determine if the mechanisms by which <br>
           their eyes operate can be replicated for use in reading CDs and similar optical storage devices
